A function can be declared with `reads **`, which allows the function to depend on anything in the heap, including the allocation state (that is, it is allowed to depend on which objects have been allocated). This allows the function to use unbounded quantifications over objects. If a function may depend on the allocation state, then, as far as the verifier is concerned, any change of the heap (including a call to a method with an empty `modifies` clause, since such a method is still allowed to change the allocation state) may change the value returned by the function.
